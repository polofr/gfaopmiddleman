    Many pediatric oncology services have already benefited from partial or total renovations thanks to the joint work of the local hospitals management supported by the CAFM.
    Nevertheless, much remains to be done ...

      For financial reasons, families stay on site during intercurations, either in the hospital (in which case there are no beds for new patients) or around the hospital in miserable conditions. 
      Sometimes families decide to return to the village but many have neither the courage nor the means to go back to the hospital. Many children are said to be "lost to sight" 
      These "Parents Home" are designed to receive these children and a member of their family throughout the treatment, thus limiting the drop-outs during treatment and offering a real improvement in living conditions families.
      In Sub-Saharan Africa, only the units in Ivoiry coast and Madagascar hav a parent's house, projects are underway for other services : 
      Togo, Mali, Centrafrique and Congo.

      <p class="mx-auto py-1">
        Arriving at the hospital is already a feat for many families, having to pay some mediacal exams is often impossible because most do not have social security coverage often because of non free access hospitals in Africa. A support fund for the most deprived has thus been set up in Mali and Ivoiry Coast in order to materially assist the families and start the treatment as soon as possible in order to give the children a better chance of recovery.

      The time of the diagnosis is extremely difficult for families, and it is also difficult for doctors to announce it.
      <br/> 
      Despite this, the announcement of a cancer diagnosis must be considered as a strategic moment, which can clearly influence further treatments. 
      This assertion is even more true for African pediatric oncology units, where socio-economic and cultural specificities mean that one in four families abandon the current treatment. As a result, it is necessary to realize that the parent met to announce the diagnosis of cancer is likely to desert with his sick child. Beyond economic reasons, these drop-outs are linked to ignorance of the disease and treatment or to the influence of local beliefs. 
      <br/>
      An announcement guide has been produced, followed by scenario films for the personnel of the pilot units and the families.
