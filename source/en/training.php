  <div class="row mx-auto text-justify py-3">
    The aim is to train medical and paramedical personnel to care for sick children locally.
    Over 15 years, more than 200 African doctors and nurses have been trained in pediatric oncology through the GFAOP in the leading cancer services.<br>
    In addition to pediatric oncologists training, other medical specialists (surgeons, pathologists, ophthalmologists, radiotherapists ...) and nurses also benefit from training related to pediatric oncology.<br>
    This is the main expense item of the association.
    Nevertheless, only 10% of children with cancer will be able to reach the specialized centers, an important awareness-raising work is under way.
    In order to accommodate a growing number of children, it is essential to increase the training capacities of the staff and the bridging skills by a training plan taking into account the needs of each country (centralized and decentralized training).

      <h3>• Internships</h3>
      These courses last from 15 days to 2 months in France, in Morocco or in some sub-Saharan African units. They are open to different disciplines in order to acquire the skills necessary for the practice of pediatric oncology. All medical and paramedical disciplines are concerned.

      <h3>• The African School of Pediatric Oncology (EAOP) in Morocco</h3>
      The school trains 20 to 30 practitioners every year during sessions in various specialties (paediatrics, surgery, nursing, etc.). 
      The African School of Pediatric Oncology (EAOP) was born thanks to the training experience of the GFAOP and of Gustave Roussy. It is the continuation in Africa of the experience gained in France by the GFAOP in the field of Pediatric Oncology training.

      This Franco-Moroccan diploma initiated by the GFAOP with the faculties of medicine of Paris-South and Rabat, is being prepared in a year. Open to about twenty students each year, this course provides theoretical courses and practical workshops in Morocco and France. It is designed to meet an ever-growing demand for childhood cancer specialists.

      The GFAOP assists unit managers in acquiring postgraduate degrees such as the Doctorate of Science enabling them to evolve in the hierarchy of their institutions. Climbing the African Hospital Administration ladder is a guarantee of the promotion of African Pediatric Oncology.

      <h3>• Nursing education</h3>
      A training program for nurses working in pediatric oncology services aims to raise awareness of the specific medical problems of children's cancer pathology.
      <br>
      Since 2014, the NGO "Laurette Fugain" supports the GFAOP, offering 2 scholarships each year to nurses from the Pilot Units. The latter benefit from two-month internships in France in the most prestigious departments, at the end of which they must produce a dissertation.

  <h2 class="pt-5 text-center">ANATOMOPATHOLOGY</h2>
  <div class="row text-justify py-3">
    <div class="col-12">
      The anatomopathology specialty is essential to confirm the clinical diagnosis of cancer patients. 
      Laboratory histological examinations, samples taken from diseased organs are used to guide the choice of treatment protocols offering the best success rates. 
      An uncertain pathology reduces the chances of success and causes precious time loss by administering expensive but inappropriate medications. 
      Therapy for childhood cancers can be compared with a war of rapid movements. The fastest the administration of fair treatment, the greater the chances of survival of the child.

          Since 2011, the GFAOP, backed by Gustave Roussy and the Institut Curie, put children's retinoblastoma among the pathologies under particular scrutiny. This cancer accounts for a significant proportion of the tumors afflicting children.
