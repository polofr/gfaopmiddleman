  <div class="row mx-auto text-justify py-3">
    The aim is to train medical and paramedical personnel to care for sick children locally.
    Over 15 years, more than 450 African doctors and nurses have been trained in pediatric oncology through the GFAOP in the leading cancer services.<br>
    In addition to pediatric oncologists training, other medical specialists (surgeons, pathologists, ophthalmologists, radiotherapists ...) and nurses also benefit from training related to pediatric oncology.<br>
    This is the main expense item of the association.
    Nevertheless, only 10% of children with cancer will be able to reach the specialized centers, an important awareness-raising work is under way.
    In order to accommodate a growing number of children, it is essential to increase the training capacities of the staff and the bridging skills by a training plan taking into account the needs of each country (centralized and decentralized training).

      <h3>• La formation infirmière</h3>
        Although training has benefited 85 nurses from 13 countries over the past 16 years, these training courses are still insufficient in number and quality. 
        Significant progress has been made in the treatment of pediatric cancers, but nursing remains a weak point for child care. 
        However, progress is essential for rigorous implementation and monitoring of treatments. 
        Beginning in 2014, in order to meet the strong expectations of the various pediatric oncology units wishing to better train nurses and retain them, an acceleration of the nursing training process was carried out :
        <ul>
          <li>A theoretical and general training in the African School of Pediatric Oncology on "Cancerology fundamentals".
            This basic one-week group training is intended for nursing teachers.
          </li>
          <li>« Pain and palliative care » training 
            The GFAOP teams are too often poorly facing pain management because of lack of training and medicines. 
            It is therefore essential to ensure adequate training for the doctor-nurse duo.
          </li>
          <li>
            The "Laurette Fugain" scholarships: since 2014, 2 fellowships have been awarded to nurses in the pilot units. The latter benefit from 2-month internships in France in the most prestigious wards.
          </li>
        </ul>
        As part of the 5- and 10-year GFAOP development project, we expect to train at least 50 nurses per year for pilot units in the Maghreb and Africa.

      <h3>"Pain and Palliative Care" classes</h3>
        The training courses "Pain and Palliative Care" classes
        Thanks to therapeutic advances in the last few years, children recover from cancer.
        In parallel, supportive care has been developed to improve the management of symptoms, especially pain, at all stages of treatment. It is important to bring these practices to Africa where pain remains poorly handled. The Sanofi Espoir Foundation through the "My Child Matters" program supports this project over 3 years.

      While surgeons and pathologists are present in all Francophone sub-Saharan African countries, they are inadequate and face multiple activities, pediatric oncology accounting for only a small portion. These two activities are crucial in the multidisciplinary care of children with cancer. Further training in pediatric oncology should continue.

      A training program for nurses working in pediatric oncology services aims to raise awareness of the specific medical problems of children's cancer pathology.

      Since 2014, the NGO "Laurette Fugain" supports the GFAOP, offering 2 scholarships each year to nurses from the Pilot Units. The latter benefit from two-month internships in France in the most prestigious departments, at the end of which they must produce a dissertation.

  <h2 class="pt-5 text-center">ANATOMOPATHOLOGY</h2>
  <div class="row text-justify py-3">
    <div class="col-12">
      The anatomopathology specialty is essential to confirm the clinical diagnosis of cancer patients. 
      Laboratory histological examinations, samples taken from diseased organs are used to guide the choice of treatment protocols offering the best success rates. 
      An uncertain pathology reduces the chances of success and causes precious time loss by administering expensive but inappropriate medications. 
      Therapy for childhood cancers can be compared with a war of rapid movements. The fastest the administration of fair treatment, the greater the chances of survival of the child.
