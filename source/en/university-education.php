      Childhood cancer is a major emerging cause of morbidity and mortality. In developed countries, it is the first cause of death for children. In developing countries, with the decrease in mortality due to infectious and nutritional diseases, cancer is becoming more and more important regarding children's health problems. However childhood cancer management requires a high level of technicality and a good organization of healthcare facilities. Nonetheless, there is no organized training for pediatric oncology yet in Africa. Training in developed countries is costly and sometimes inappropriate to the candidate's practice. The setting up of a University diploma carried out by the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Rabat in partnership with the University Paris South, thus fills this gap and contributes to the development of oncology. This training was largely inspired by the IDPO (Interuniversity Diploma of Pediatric Oncology) organized at the Gustave Roussy Institute and thanks to which numerous African pediatric oncologists have been trained in pediatric oncology.
